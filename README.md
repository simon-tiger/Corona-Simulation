## Install

### Easy Way
Click on "Clone or Download". Click on "Download ZIP".  You should have a `.zip` file in your Downloads. Unzip the file afterwards.

### Overly-Fancy Way
You may want to do this if you want to keep yourself up-to-date on the project. Open a terminal window. Enter the command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/simon-tiger/Corona-Simulation.git
```

You should then have the project in your working directory. If you want to keep yourself up-to-date on the project, you can go to the project folder, and type:

```
$ git pull origin master
```

This will match your copy with the one on GitHub.

### Run It!
This is where Processing comes in. Open the project folder. Open the folder for whichever simulation you want to run.
You should find a `.pde` file where the filename is the name of the simulation. Open it in Processing.
Click the "Play" button in the top left (or press Cmd+R). You should have the simulation running.
